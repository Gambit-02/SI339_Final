                <p>Ukiyo-e, a distinctive form of Japanese art, emerged in Edo (modern Tokyo) during the Edo Period (1615-1868), 
                under the peaceful rule of the Tokugawa shoguns. This era saw the creation of a social hierarchy by the shoguns, 
                relegating merchants, despite their wealth, to a lower status while stripping them of political power.
                As a response, these merchants allied with artists, publishers, and townspeople to cultivate Ukiyo-e, 
                leveraging art and culture to gain cultural prestige outside the conventional powers of shogunate and religious institutions. 
                Originally perceived as "low" art meant for non-elite classes, Ukiyo-e is celebrated for its high artistic and technical quality, 
                requiring profound visual, textual, and cultural literacy.</p></div>

                <p>In the early Edo period, ukiyo-e started as one-piece black-ink only woodblock prints that had become separated from illustration 
                inserts in printed books. The drawings were circulated in towns and spread among the common people for their enjoyment. 
                Eventually people became dissatisfied with simple black-ink only prints and demanded more colorful designs.
                 As a result, a few techniques to add colors to black-ink only prints were invented to meet the demand, 
                 but these techniques could not be used for mass production as the prints were hand-colored using a brush.</p></div>

                <p>Ukiyo-e prints depicted the popular culture of the time, frequently highlighting the pleasure that arose
                     from the burgeoning leisure activities made possible by Japan's expanding economy, such as entertainment and travel. 
                     Key themes in ukiyo-e prints included kabuki theater actors and "beauties," typically courtesans, entertainers,
                      and stylish women. Additionally, these prints often featured historical and mythical warriors, heroes, and an array 
                      of fantastical beings like ghosts and demons.</p></div>
