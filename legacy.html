                <p>
                    Claude Monet's "Water Lilies with Japanese Bridge" series, painted at his Giverny garden, showcases a profound influence
                     from the ukiyo-e art movement, specifically in its composition and choice of subjects. The serene depiction of nature,
                      a hallmark of ukiyo-e prints, is mirrored in Monet's tranquil water scenes, which emphasize the interplay of light, water,
                       and flora. The Japanese bridge in Monetâ€™s garden, an element directly borrowed from Japanese garden aesthetics, serves 
                       as a focal point in these paintings, linking them visually and thematically to the bridges often depicted in ukiyo-e
                        landscapes. This blending of Japanese motifs with Impressionist techniques reflects the deep admiration Monet had for 
                        Japanese art, which significantly shaped his approach to the depiction of light and nature in his later works.</p></div>

                <p>Mary Cassatt, an American impressionist like Claude Monet, was deeply inspired by the ukiyo-e movement, which is evident in her reinterpretation of her characteristic themes
                     of women and children. Influenced by the Japanese approach, she employed flat colors and conveyed depth solely through lines,
                      moving away from the Western tradition of using tone. This technique is prominently showcased in her print, "The Coiffure,"
                       where a woman is depicted in the simple act of brushing her hair. The print echoes the style of Kitagawa Utamaro's "
                       Takashima Ohisa Using Two Mirrors to Observe Her Coiffure," highlighting the enduring appeal of the ukiyo-e style even 
                       a century later. Cassatt's adoption of ukiyo-e techniques not only refreshed her artistic approach but also bridged cultural
                        and temporal gaps, bringing a timeless quality to her work.</p></div>

                <p>Even modern day manga can find their origins in the Ukiyo-e movement. It was actually Hokusai himself who coined
                    the term "manga" to describe informal drawings and sketches. Over time, the meaning of the word changed to describe 
                    Japanese comics rather than simply practice sketches. The photo shown is one of the pages of the original "Hokusai Manga",
                     which was a compendium of reference material and poses for artists at the time.
