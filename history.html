                    The earilest recognized ukiyo-e artist, Hishikawa Moronobu, is best recognized for his piece titled mikaeri bijin (Looking Back Beauty).
                     Initially, as an independent artist, he focused on creating black ink illustrations for books, 
                     which were printed using woodblock techniques and remained unsigned. Over time, Moronobu distinguished himself 
                     as a master artist, concentrating on crafting individual woodblock prints and hand-drawn works exclusively in black ink.
                      His diligent efforts laid the groundwork for the future evolution of ukiyo-e.</p></div>

                    In the mid-eighteenth century, multicolored ukiyo-e prints began to appear, utilizing woodblock printing techniques 
                    for colored inks instead of the traditional hand-applied brushwork. The color range of these early multicolored prints 
                    was relatively restricted. For instance, benizuri-e, or "pink printed pictures," primarily featured pink and green 
                    as the dominant colors.</p></div>

                <p>Beginning in the 1760s and continuing into the early 20th century, full-color nishiki-e prints became widely popular. 
                    The term "nishiki-e" translates to "brocade picture," a reference to the vibrant color schemes reminiscent of silk brocades.
                    These prints featured a variety of color applications, including solo color prints, layered color techniques, 
                    and blends of different hues.</p></div>
